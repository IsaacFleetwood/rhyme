\section{Introduction}

TODO: need a query that shows the expressiveness or power of the query language, comparing it with the same query 
written in other query languages

What should be the story/pitch here?

- semi-structured data is prevalent in many places, including modern web applications.

- languages like graphql, JQ, JSONiq, SQL++, etc. exists to handle such data.

- however, they are less expressive, doesn't permit (easy) code gen, cannot operate inside the browser, etc.

- in this work, we present a new query language, that is targeted to query nested structures and produce
nested structures as results, resembles existing object notation (like GraphQL), permit query optimization (e.g., de-correlation)
and efficient code generation, and compositional and easy to meta-program


RPAI~\cite{rpai} (need at least one cite for bibtex :-P)

The query language provides a unified language that handles multiple aspects:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item High-performance nested, hetrogenius querying language (like JSONiq or JQ, XQuery)
    that is compiled for maximal performance

    \item permit query optimization and code generation, utilizing an existing compiler
    infrastructure

    \item can run in the browser (everything in JS), essentially making every 

    \item an expressive language that provides a unified representation of functions,
     records, and tables the provides an easier way to specify front-end (dashboard-style) logic
    (think GraphQL, but more powerful with having GUI elements, etc. part of the query?)
    \item more capabilities like recursive queries (with semi-naive evaluation),
    incrementality, etc.
\end{enumerate}
